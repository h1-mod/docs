## "MISSING FILE" error

- The inability to load the necessary files (`MISSING FILE eng_code_pre_gfx_mp.ff`) usually happens due to file structure in Steam version and can be fixed by using [MWR Files Cleaner](https://github.com/skkuull/mwr-files-cleaner) or doing the following:

1. Move all .bik files to `/raw/video/` folder
2. Move all .ff, .pak files and localization folder (`english` or any other) to `/zone/` folder

- Install DLCs

- Make sure your language zone folder is valid. The default language is `english`, so this could also be it.

## "Create2DTexture" error

- Any of the following can fix this issue:
